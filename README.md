Commonly used Python IDEs include:

PyCharm: Offers advanced features like code analysis, a powerful debugger, and integration with various tools.
VS Code (Visual Studio Code): Popular for its extensibility and wide range of plugins for Python development.
Spyder: Often used in scientific computing, part of the Anaconda distribution.
Jupyter Notebook/Lab: Popular for interactive data analysis and visualization.
IDLE: The default IDE that comes with Python.

Best Practices in Software Engineering
Logging: The implementation of logging instead of print statements shows knowledge of best practices in handling output and errors, which is crucial for building robust and maintainable software.
Logging vs. Printing
Separation of Concerns
Error Handling: The try-except blocks and appropriate error logging indicate an understanding of how to manage and communicate errors effectively.
Return Values

Library and API Design
Reusable Code: Ability to write reusable and modular code, which is a key aspect of library and API development. The codes are structured to allow for flexibility and extension.

User-Centric Design: Methods that return data rather than printing directly, allowing users to handle and manipulate the data as needed.
API Design


Advanced Python Programming
Object-Oriented Design: The use of classes and methods suggests a solid understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP). 
Type Hinting: The use of type hints (e.g., -> pd.DataFrame) indicates familiarity with modern Python practices that improve code readability and help with debugging and maintenance.

Familiarity with Data Handling and Pandas
Domain Knowledge

Maintainability: Clean structure, proper naming conventions, and use of type hints. The importance of writing code that can be easily maintained and understood by others.

Advanced programming skills, adherence to best practices, and domain-specific knowledge
